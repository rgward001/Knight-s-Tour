# Knight-s-Tour
This is a project that I worked on in my sophmore year of college in my Data Structures and Algorithms class. We wanted to take the well known Kight's Tour problem and apply that process to a pathfinding algorithm to find the shortest path between two given points on a chess board. The use can specify the size of the chessboard and then is asked to enter a starting point and an ending point. This will then move the chess piece in the minimum amount of moves to go from start to finish. There are probably many things I that I can optimize about this looking back, but it gave me a good introduction to graph traversal and pathfinding algorithms.
